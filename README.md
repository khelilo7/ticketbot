# ticketbot
Read ticket image and get texte from it

You will find two scripts : 
## ticketbot.js : 
in this one i used a library named okrabyte, which did not work i am guessing its a language issue
## ticketbot-tesseract.js : 
in this script i used tesseract which is concedred as the most curate open-source OCR engines then available.
It gave me a good result as far as you asked, you tell me if you need more specifics but I don't know if I would have the time, I am working bro :p 
an OCR is Optical character recognition or optical character reade is the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a scene-photo [source wikipeadia :p]
## Instalation : 
Easy just:
```sh
$ cd Ticketbot
$ npm install
$ node ticketbot-tesseract.js
```
to install all the packgesand run the script, enjoy
